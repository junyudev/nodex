# Nodex - Product Specification

## Overview

Nodex is a local SQLite-based kanban board designed for managing coding agents (e.g., Claude Code). It runs as an Electron desktop app with a Notion-like UI, and also serves a web interface accessible from any browser. All data is stored in a SQLite database that agents can interact with via REST API. Supports multiple independent projects, each with its own kanban board, history, and undo/redo stacks.

Desktop runtime requirement: macOS 12 Monterey or later. Nodex ships separate notarized Apple silicon (`arm64`) and Intel (`x64`) macOS builds.

## Problem Statement

When working with coding agents like Claude Code, there's no streamlined way to:
1. Visualize and manage task queues across different stages
2. Allow agents to update their own status without complex integrations
3. Track agent progress in real-time
4. Maintain a simple, portable task state

## Goals

1. **Agent-Native**: Agents use REST API to read/write task status
2. **Real-Time Sync**: UI reflects changes instantly via SSE
3. **Human-Friendly**: Notion-like UI for manual task management
4. **Portable**: Single SQLite database file, easy to backup/restore
5. **Local-First**: No external dependencies or cloud services required
6. **Multi-Project**: Independent kanban boards per project

## Non-Goals

- Multi-user collaboration features
- Cloud sync or remote storage
- Mobile-responsive design (desktop-first)
- Complex workflow automation (keep it simple)

## Features

### Core Features

#### 1. Multi-Project Support
- Each project has an independent kanban board, history, and undo/redo
- Single-page app with staged workbench shell (left sidebar stage map + horizontal stage rail)
- Stage order: `View -> Card -> Thread -> Diff`
- Sidebar stage sections provide each stage's tab group; stage panels avoid duplicate in-panel tab strips
- Stage rail layout modes:
  - `Sliding window` (default): renders a sliding 1-4 stage window
  - `Full rail`: renders all stages in one horizontal strip
- Focus model is niri-inspired: focused stage is emphasized and auto-revealed in the active layout mode
- `Shift + mouse wheel` inside the stage rail only performs native panel scrolling; it does not change focused stage.
- Full-rail stage widths are user-resizable by dragging either left or right border of a stage panel
- Resizing a full-rail stage panel updates only that panel width (adjacent panel widths stay unchanged)
- Sliding-window mode supports 1-4 visible stage panes; requested pane count persists globally across projects
- Sliding-window mode includes resizable separators between adjacent panes; separator drag updates pane widths in real time and persists per-stage widths globally
- Sliding-window mode auto-caps effective visible panes by available width while preserving requested pane count
- Workbench top toolbar includes sidebar collapse plus sliding-window pane-count controls flanking the minimap; `-` sits to the left of the minimap and always removes the current right-most pane, while `+` sits to the right and tries to append the next pane on the right before falling back to prepending the left pane at the right edge
- The View stage has its own sticky top toolbar; it keeps the DB view selector pinned above board, list, toggle-list, canvas, and calendar content, task search expands inline inside the toolbar's trailing action cluster, and `kanban` / `list` / `toggle-list` expose shared view-local filter and sort popovers there
- The main DB views keep a consistent inner gutter under the sticky View-stage toolbar so list, calendar, and canvas align with the existing board/toggle-list spacing instead of sitting flush against the stage edge
- URL sync: `/?project=<id>`, persisted to localStorage
- Sidebar project switcher selects the DB-stage datasource only; it does not reset Card/Thread/Terminal stage contexts
- Task search query is persisted per project and restored on space switching; search lives in the sticky View-stage toolbar alongside the DB view selector
- `Cmd/Ctrl+K` and `Cmd/Ctrl+P` open a global command palette that searches cards across projects by default; typing a `>` prefix switches the palette into command mode for shell actions such as opening settings, task search, project picker, terminal, stage focus, and view switches, and `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` opens that same palette with `>` already prefilled. Card results use fuzzy full-text ranking across title, description, tags, assignee, agent status, column, project name, and card id; matching terms are highlighted in titles and other matched metadata, and matching description results render a three-line contextual preview with inline highlights
- `Cmd/Ctrl+[` and `Cmd/Ctrl+]` navigate backward/forward through durable workbench context (active DB project/view, focused stage, selected card session or history tab, selected thread tab, selected diff tab) without including transient overlays such as settings, command palette, task search, or terminal chrome
- The command palette always includes `Go back` and `Go forward` commands with matching keyboard hints; those commands are shown disabled when there is no history in that direction
- Desktop supports multi-window in a single app process (`Cmd/Ctrl+N`): each window keeps independent navigation/session state while all windows share the same SQLite data and realtime board-change fanout
- When Nodex opens a window from zero open windows (cold launch, macOS re-activate after all windows were closed), it restores the last focused window's DB view, open card/history session, selected thread tab, and `Recents` list
- Windows opened while another window is already open still start with a fresh workbench session; restart restore does not clone the current window into every new window
- Back/forward navigation history is window-session-local and is restored only from that window's session storage; it is not part of the cold-launch resume snapshot saved when all windows close
- Desktop single-instance behavior is scoped per resolved server profile (`KANBAN_DIR`/`config.toml` dir). Different profile dirs can run at the same time (for example packaged release + dev build), while each profile still enforces one process with many windows.
- Card Stage open/close + selected card state is global across spaces/projects and rendered in the Card stage
- Clicking a card from the View stage in sliding-window mode ensures the Card stage is visible in the current window (`View -> Card`) by refocusing when needed
- Recent card sessions are persisted in a top-level sidebar `Recents` group across all projects, capped at 10 entries
- Entering/selecting a card never mutates `Recents`; leaving a card adds it to the front only if it is not already present, and existing entries keep their current position
- Selecting a recent card session from another project opens that card in the Card stage without changing the currently active project
- Projects with no recent card sessions do not auto-select the History overlay in the Card stage
- Sidebar rows use consistent nested indentation, with quiet top-level section labels for `Recents`, `Cards`, `Threads`, and `Diffs`, plus collapsible status subheaders in `Cards` that start collapsed by default
- Each top-level sidebar section header includes a `more actions` menu for changing its default row limit (`5`, `10`, `15`, or `20` items), moving the section up/down among visible top-level sections, and hiding the section
- The sidebar `Cards` stage group shows the current DB project's cards grouped by non-empty, collapsible status sections in canonical board order (`Ideas` -> `Done`), using title-only rows and per-section counts; status sections start collapsed by default, and collapsed sections may still surface their active card row so the current selection stays visible
- Sidebar stage sections show at most each section's configured default row limit per subsection/list by default, with clickable `Show more` / `Show less` controls for longer lists
- Sidebar status-subheader collapse state and per-section `Show more` / `Show less` state persist per project across reloads
- Sidebar stage collapse/expand and show-more/show-less interactions animate list height and row visibility
- Hidden top-level sidebar sections stay hidden until re-enabled from Settings -> Workspace -> `Sidebar sections`, and then return in their previously saved order
- When the sidebar is collapsed, hovering the left window edge reveals a transient floating sidebar without shifting the stage rail; moving away or pressing `Escape` dismisses it while keeping the sidebar collapsed
- Sidebar footer includes a settings trigger in the same row as project spaces/switcher controls; this opens a full-page settings overlay with a left navigation rail, a `Back to app` affordance, flat section dividers, dense `Workspace`, `Editor`, and `Card` sections (`Theme`, `Stage rail layout`, `Thread finished notifications`, `App updates`, `Sidebar sections`, `Sans font size`, `Code font size`, `Spellcheck`, `Auto-link while typing`, `Auto-link on paste`, `Recognize bare domains`, `Large paste text threshold`, `Large paste description soft limit`, `Open markdown file links in`, `Confirm thread section send`, `Kanban card properties`, `Card stage collapsed properties`), a `Worktrees` section (`Worktree start mode`, `Auto branch prefix`, managed-worktree inventory), plus a `Backups` section (auto-backup on/off, frequency hours, backup retention, history retention, manual backup, restore). `Sans font size` defaults to `15px`, persists locally, updates `--vscode-font-size`, and scales the shared sans typography tokens used by the renderer; `Code font size` defaults to `14px`, persists locally, and sets `--vscode-editor-font-size` globally.
- On macOS, traffic-light window controls stay visible at top-left; when the sidebar is expanded, the sidebar collapse control sits beside them in the sidebar top strip, and when collapsed the same control is rendered in the titlebar left region
- Card stage session selection lives in the sidebar alongside the current DB project's grouped card navigator; card history opens as a card-specific overlay from Card Stage
- Settings can choose which optional card-stage rows start behind the Card Stage `more properties` toggle (`Tags`, `Assignee`, `Threads`, `Schedule`, `Agent blocked`, and `Agent status`)
- Terminal is a global bottom foldable panel (VS Code-like) with mixed tabs (`project` shell tabs and `card` shell tabs)
- Terminal panel open/closed state and panel height persist globally in shell state
- `Cmd/Ctrl + J` toggles the global terminal panel from anywhere in the app
- Thread stage is a live Codex workspace in Electron (auth, linked threads, streaming events, approvals)
- Answered `request_user_input` prompts remain visible in the transcript as a compact `Asked N question(s)` disclosure row that stays collapsed by default and expands to show the question/answer pairs
- When a completed turn's latest plan item is non-empty, the composer swaps into an `Implement this plan?` request surface with `Yes, implement this plan` plus an inline `No, and tell Codex what to do differently` freeform path; accepting sends a follow-up prompt prefixed with `PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:` and resets collaboration mode to `Default` for that follow-up turn
- Follow-up prompts sent to an already-running turn appear in the transcript immediately on submit, before `turn/steer` returns; if steering fails the temporary row is rolled back, and if steering succeeds the later authoritative user-message item deduplicates the temporary row instead of rendering twice
- Thread stage project context is stage-local (`threadsProjectId`) and remains stable when DB datasource changes
- By default, desktop notifications fire when a Codex thread finishes; the notification title uses the thread title and the body uses the latest turn message. Settings can disable this.
- Packaged macOS builds can check for stable app updates on launch in the background, download them automatically when found, expose a manual `Check now` action in Settings -> Workspace -> `App updates`, expose `Check for Updates…` in the macOS app menu, and require an explicit `Restart to Update` action before installation.
- Diff stage is an interactive placeholder in this release
- Create/delete projects via switcher dropdown or CLI
- Default project "default" seeded on first boot
- In Electron, startup opens into a blocking bootstrap surface until local initialization completes; if a future supported SQLite schema migration is running, that surface shows determinate migration progress and migration-specific status copy
- Project ID: lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens (e.g., `my-project`)
- Project icon: optional per-project emoji persisted in SQLite; when empty, UI shows a project-colored dot
- Project workspace path: optional filesystem path persisted per project and used as Codex thread `cwd`
- Sidebar project header shows the current workspace path under the project title; a folder icon/button opens a native directory picker and saves the selection
- Project icon input in the spaces switcher includes a button that opens the native macOS emoji picker panel
- CASCADE delete removes all cards and history for a project
- Codex thread links are one-owner: one card can own many threads, each thread belongs to one card

#### 2. Kanban Board View
- 8 columns representing workflow stages
- Drag-and-drop cards between columns
- Each kanban column header includes a `more actions` popover for collapsing that column and adjusting its persisted expanded width; collapsed columns still show their card count and the same `more actions` trigger
- Shift-click in Kanban toggles a temporary multi-selection from the clicked card; selection can span columns, dragging moves the whole selected set together as one grouped undo step, and dropping into editors inserts one `cardToggle` per selected card before deleting all source cards in the same grouped action
- Native block drag from visible NFM editors (Card Stage, including projected inline embed rows) into Kanban columns creates card(s) using move semantics (source blocks are removed)
- Dragging a Kanban card into a visible NFM editor (Card Stage, including projected inline embed rows) creates a standalone `cardToggle` snapshot block and removes the source card (move semantics)
- Card->editor drop is pointer-anchored, blocks self-drop, supports same-project and cross-project sources, and persists as one grouped undo/redo action (target description update + source card delete)
- Card->editor drag shows a live in-editor insertion line (matching BlockNote drop-cursor semantics) even though the drag source is the Kanban native drag runtime
- `cardToggle` chips (`priority`, `estimate`, `status`) are editable inline in NFM editors and mutate both serialized `meta` and embedded snapshot payload
- In NFM editors, `cardToggle` property chips sit in the same inline text flow as the toggle title, so wrapped titles use the full row width like inline kanban card properties instead of a separate leading chip column
- Dragging a `cardToggle` block back into Kanban creates card(s) with snapshot-preserved properties (priority/estimate/tags/assignee/due-date/scheduled-start/scheduled-end/blocked) plus current title/description edits
- Block-drop card creation uses pointer-based insertion (top/middle/bottom) with a visible drop indicator
- Block->card import supports strict smart shorthand parsing for non-`cardToggle` blocks (`0..4`, optional estimate `XS/S/M/L/XL`, optional `(tag)`), applying parsed values to `priority`, `estimate`, and `tags`
- Visual card previews with priority badges
- Kanban card reorder keeps a non-layout-shifting insertion indicator; the source card stays as a static ghost in place while dragging, same-column reorders do not live-shift sibling cards, columns do not tint as separate previews, the drag overlay is geometry-matched to the source card so it starts aligned with the cursor, and dropping on the visual gap between cards still inserts into that gap instead of falling through to column-end append
- The Kanban insert-position indicator is resolved against the remaining non-dragged cards in the target surface, so same-column and multi-card drags never draw the line above a dragged ghost when the actual drop will land before the next remaining card
- Kanban card property chips (priority/estimate/tags/assignee) render inline with the card title by default, and Settings can move them above the title or below the body
- Right-clicking a Kanban card opens a Radix context menu with a searchable action list; `Copy deeplink` copies an `nodex://cards/<card-id>` deeplink to the target card, `Delete` removes the card, and clicking `Move to` advances the same menu into a searchable in-place project picker that moves the card into the same workflow column in the selected project
- Real-time updates when data changes
- Card updates include revision-based stale-write detection: stale edits return typed `conflict` results instead of silent last-write-wins
- Card Stage surfaces conflicts inline with explicit recovery actions: `Reload Latest` (drop local draft fields) and `Overwrite Mine` (retry on newest revision)
- Header task search supports token-contains matching across title/description/tags/assignee/agent status/id in Kanban, All Tasks, and Toggle List views
- Kanban card drag-and-drop stays available while search or toolbar filters are active; reordering maps the visible drop slot back into the underlying board order so hidden non-matching cards keep their relative position
- When a non-default toolbar sort is active in Kanban view, cards remain draggable across columns and into editors, but same-column manual re-ranking is disabled because the active sort, not board order, owns the visible ordering
- Native block-drop import into Kanban remains blocked under free-text search, but structured filter/sort views can still accept imports when Nodex can either preserve an exact visible slot by inferring safe workflow properties or clearly downgrade to column-level create feedback

#### 3. Toggle-List View
- Third project page tab (`Toggle List`) renders cards as top-level toggle rows in a specialized BlockNote editor
- Each top-level toggle row maps to one card: editable title in row header, with description mapped to child blocks
- Toggle-list editor uses the same shared slash-menu controller as Card Stage (defaults + custom blocks) to keep insertion UX aligned
- Inline embeds (`cardRef`, `toggleListInlineView`) use single-editor projection: referenced card rows are projected as children in the host NFM editor (no nested BlockNote editor instances)
- Projection sync for inline embeds is shared per editor instance (one listener set + owner registry) instead of per-embed listeners, so typing latency remains stable with many embeds open
- Board state sync is shared per project (`useKanban` store-backed): one realtime subscription/fetch pipeline fans out to all consumers and exposes O(1) `cardIndex` lookup
- Card description toggles in Toggle List + inline toggle-list embeds honor NFM `▼` (expanded) / `▶` (collapsed) prefixes on load, and toggle-click changes are persisted back to card descriptions (and synced across views)
- View-toolbar filter/sort controls:
  - `kanban`, `list`, and top-level `toggle-list` share one view-local filter model with grouped logic (`OR` across groups, `AND` within group) and status/priority/tag clauses
  - Priority clauses can explicitly include or exclude empty priority values via the `-` filter chip instead of treating empties as an implicit side effect of selecting all concrete priorities
  - Each supported view has its own persisted sort stack; list-header sort clicks write through to the same shared toolbar sort state
  - When active, filter/sort rules surface as compact pills in a collapsible bottom band inside the toolbar; the sort side uses one leading chip (`Field` with direction for a single sort, `n sorts` for multiple) separated from filter chips by a thin divider
- View-stage display controls move into the toolbar `Display` popover:
  - `kanban`: reorder + hide/show board-card properties for `priority`, `estimate`, `tags`, `assignee`
  - `toggle-list`: reorder + hide/show row properties for `priority`, `estimate`, `status`, `tags`
  - `kanban` and `toggle-list` can also show empty `priority` / `estimate` values as neutral `-` chips, using the same styling in both views; kanban keeps those empty chips editable through the same inline property menu used by filled chips
- Row properties render as Notion-like chips (priority/estimate/status) matching existing board/card-stage visual language
- Toggle-list editor surface reuses the same `nfm-editor` styling layer used by Card Stage for consistent typography/spacing/toggle visuals
- Bi-directional sync:
  - editor title/description edits sync back to card updates
  - board updates from Kanban/List/card-stage refresh toggle rows
  - projected-row edits apply local optimistic card patches before remote persistence so board/list views reflect changes immediately
- Structural guard blocks manual insert/delete/reorder/type-change of top-level card rows; structure is rule-driven
- Supported DB view filter/sort/display settings persist per project and per view in renderer localStorage

#### 4. SQLite Database Storage
- Single `kanban.db` file in kanban directory
- Atomic transactions for data integrity
- Schema v26 with UUID-v7 card ids, description revision storage, Codex thread-link metadata keyed by `thread_id`, recurring reminder state, and project-scoped realtime/history state

#### 5. Card Properties

#### 6. Inline Card Creator
- Notion-style inline form in each column
- Cards created via the inline creator are inserted at the top of the current column
- Quick-add with optional priority, estimate, tags
- Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- Priority/estimate dropdowns use Radix Select popper positioning for reliable rendering with custom trigger chips
- Click-outside save/cancel logic ignores portaled select menus so property selection does not dismiss the creator

#### 7. Card Stage Editor
- Notion-style slide-out panel for card details
- Always-editable fields (no edit mode toggle)
- Auto-save on close (1s debounce + immediate save on blur)
- Card Stage visibility context is global: switching spaces/projects and views keeps the current Card Stage state/card until explicitly closed
- Card Stage draft fields survive view/space switching because local patch/update/move operations keep the active card snapshot in sync
- Card Stage priority uses an explicit empty state by default; empty priority renders as a subdued placeholder in selectors and is omitted from dense card badges.
- Card Stage Properties includes schedule editing with an `All-day` mode toggle.
- Card Stage Properties includes a `Run in` selector for new thread execution target: `Local project` (with optional folder override picker), `New worktree` (base-branch selector + environment selector for `.codex/environments/*.toml`), and `Cloud` (mock/unavailable).
- Timed mode uses start/end `datetime-local` inputs with quick actions (`Set schedule`, `Now + 1h`, `Clear`) and automatic end-after-start guardrails.
- All-day mode uses start/end `date` inputs (end shown as inclusive in UI, persisted as end-exclusive storage) with the same guardrails.
- Tag input suggests existing project tags while typing via native autocomplete options (excluding tags already on the current card)
- BlockNote block editor for description (Notion-flavored Markdown)
- NFM headings use a typography scale in-editor: H1 `1.875em`, H2 `1.5em`, H3 `1.25em`, H4 `1.125em`, all at `600` weight with `1.3` line-height relative to the editor body size
- Card Stage toolbar includes a `Show raw` toggle that swaps the description area into a read-only raw NFM view of the current local draft for debugging, without changing card fields or save behavior.
- BlockNote structural animations are mostly disabled in-editor (including indent/unindent depth transitions) to keep editing interactions immediate
- NFM link labels are escape-normalized on parse, so repeated auto-save cycles remain idempotent (prevents exponential backslash growth on escaped markdown markers inside link text)
- NFM autolink behavior is renderer-configurable: typing and paste recognition can be toggled independently, bare-domain recognition defaults on, and paste-time matching is intentionally strict enough to leave repo paths, slash-separated path segments, local file paths, and filename-like text such as `foo/bar/baz.md`, `local/code-block-mock-ui/action-menu-popper.com`, or `nfm-editor-copy-behavior.md` plain by default
- Detailed autolink rules and examples: [NFM Editor Autolink Behavior](./nfm-editor-autolink-behavior.md)
- Card writes are validated before persistence (field limits + enum/type checks), and oversized HTTP payloads for create/update are rejected with `413`
- `Shift+Enter` hard line breaks are persisted within the same block across app restarts
- Enter-created blank paragraph lines are persisted as `<empty-block/>` and preserved across app restarts
- Thread sections are supported via `<thread-section ... />` blocks: they render as divider-like runnable section headers in the Card Stage editor, bind to a sticky per-section Codex thread, and define a prompt as the marker's direct children plus all following sibling blocks in the same parent collection until the next thread section, excluding nested child thread-section ranges; typing `---` on an empty paragraph inserts a new thread-section marker by default, sending opens a plain-text confirmation preview by default, and sending from unsectioned content inserts a new marker before the current block
- Toggle headings (`▶# Heading`) supported: headings with collapsible children, matching Notion's toggle heading behaviour
- Toggle open/closed state is persisted in NFM using `▼` (expanded) / `▶` (collapsed) markers; state survives save/reload cycles via a localStorage bridge that pre-populates BlockNote's `defaultToggledState` on editor init and reads DOM `data-show-children` on save
- `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` across a collapsed toggle boundary preserve browser-native visual-line movement and never jump into hidden edge non-inline children while the toggle stays collapsed
- Typing `## ` inside a toggle header converts it to a toggle heading (preserves toggle state)
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` sends the current explicit thread section from the Card Stage editor without moving focus to the Threads stage; if the cursor is on a toggle header or `cardToggle` row, the editor preserves toggle-expand behavior instead of sending
- `Enter` at end of an open toggle header (or toggle heading) with no children still creates a first child paragraph (Notion fallback) instead of a sibling block
- `Enter` in the middle or at the end of any inline parent block that already has children splits trailing parent text into a new first child paragraph
- `Backspace` at the start of a leaf child block under an inline parent always merges into the previous sibling, or into the parent if it is the first child
- `Enter` at the start of an empty leaf child block under an inline parent creates a sibling paragraph in the same child group instead of unindenting
- Existing divider blocks remain normal `---` separators unless explicitly converted; only the fresh typed `---` shortcut inserts a thread-section marker by default
- `Cmd+A` selects only the current block content while editing
- Normal copy/cut uses one cut-aware clipboard model across `blocknote/html`, `text/html`, and structure-preserving `text/plain`; it preserves the rich clipboard payloads and rewrites `nodex://assets/...` paths only in `text/plain` for external use when the sync asset-path prefix is available
- Detailed copy rules and examples: [NFM Editor Copy Behavior](./nfm-editor-copy-behavior.md)
- `Cmd/Ctrl+F` opens in-editor find for NFM description with sticky find bar, match count, previous/next navigation (`Enter`/`Shift+Enter`), and highlighted matches; when editor text is selected, the find query seeds from that selection
- Replace controls are hidden by default and shown in a second row only when toggled; supports `Replace` (current match) and `Replace All`
- Find/replace UI uses a floating dark two-row panel (top: find + nav, bottom: replace) anchored in-editor without shifting document content
- Search includes text inside collapsed toggles; collapsed toggle ancestors are expanded only when navigating to a matched result inside them
- Drag-hovering collapsed toggle headers (`toggleListItem`, toggle headings, and `cardToggle` rows including projected rows under `cardRef` / `toggleListInlineView`) keeps a stable, Notion-style overlay highlight with pointer-coordinate hit-testing plus drop-time active-target fallback for side-menu retargeting (no rapid flicker), and supports diagnostics via `window.__TOGGLE_DND_DEBUG__ = true`
- Image blocks are supported in NFM (`<image source="...">Caption</image>`) and render in both editor and read-only previews
- Mouse drag/range selections that span image blocks show a blue-tinted image-block highlight/outline so inclusion is visually explicit
- Image block floating toolbar includes `Copy image` (copies image bytes when supported, otherwise copies resolved image URL text)
- Pressing `Space` while an image block is focused opens a larger centered modal preview; pressing `Space` again closes it (Esc/click outside also close)
- Double-clicking an image block opens the same large preview modal
- Image preview modal includes zoom controls (`+`, `-`, reset) with a visible zoom percentage
- Pasting images uploads them to shared local assets and inserts image blocks automatically
- Pasting from Notion preserves block structure (including toggle blocks and nested children) when Notion clipboard metadata is present
- Notion paste preserves inline rich text marks (`bold`, `italic`, `strikethrough`, `code`, `underline`) and inline text/background colors from Notion annotation metadata (`h` color tokens)
- When pasting plain text that exceeds the configurable `Large paste text threshold` (default `100,000`) or would push the description near the configurable `Large paste description soft limit` (default `750,000`), Nodex intercepts the paste and offers `Save in Nodex`, `Paste anyway`, or `Cancel`, with a truncated, scrollable preview of the pasted text and character/line metadata in the dialog
- On Electron desktop, if the native clipboard exposes actual file or folder entries, Nodex intercepts the paste before default BlockNote handling. File paste offers `Save in Nodex`, `Keep as link`, or `Cancel`; folder paste offers only `Keep as link` or `Cancel`. Plain copied absolute paths in `text/plain` do not trigger this prompt, and browser runtime does not promise file/folder paste parity
- `Save in Nodex` stores pasted text/files in shared local assets and inserts an inline `attachment` chip. Saved text-like attachments open a scrollable preview capped to `200` lines or `64 KiB`
- `Keep as link` inserts an inline `attachment` chip that references the original absolute path for pasted files/folders; this option is not shown for oversized plain-text prompts, and it is the only supported folder-paste action
- `Paste anyway` bypasses the attachment flow and inserts the oversized text directly into the note despite the warning
- Attachment chips stay inline with surrounding paragraph content, show only concise label/icon chrome, reveal a short hover hint, and open a click popover with metadata plus `Open`, `Reveal`, `Copy path`, and `Open original` actions when an original path exists
- Detailed attachment-chip rules and examples: [NFM Editor Attachment Chip Behavior](./nfm-editor-attachment-chip-behavior.md)
- Slash menu (`/`) for inserting block types
- Slash menu includes a custom `Toggle List Inline View` block insertion item
- `Toggle List Inline View` is a custom NFM block (`<toggle-list-inline-view ... />`) that renders a low-distraction inline sequence of toggle rows for a chosen source project
- Inline block row headers reuse existing property chip styles (`priority`, `estimate`, `status`) on the same title line
- Inline block is rendered full-width in the editor flow with a chrome-less container (no extra wrapper margin/padding/background/indent), card rows use the standard toggle-caret icon style, and `toggleListInlineView` block-content padding is reset to `0`
- Inline embed root rows explicitly cancel BlockNote nested-group left margin so `toggleListInlineView` rows stay left-aligned with surrounding blocks
- Inline controls remain available via lightweight top-right actions without adding persistent container chrome
- `toggleListInlineView` top-right action bar includes a dedicated drag handle button that drags the embed owner block directly
- `cardRef` owner dragging is available from the left BlockNote side-menu drag handle; when hovering projected rows/descendants, the handle targets the owning `cardRef` block (not the projected child row)
- Inline block actions support source-project selection and foldable advanced rules editing (single dense control surface), with rules-panel expanded state persisted in localStorage (not in NFM block props)
- Inline toggle-list rules persist canonically as `rulesV2` (base64url JSON); old status/priority/tag/rank attrs are ignored, and explicit empty-priority filters serialize in canonical `rulesV2` rather than depending on legacy “all priorities” behavior.
- `toggleListInlineView` excludes the current host document card by default when source project matches the host; users can include it from Rules (`Include current host card`)
- Inline card rows are projected directly into the host NFM editor tree as child `cardToggle` rows; drag handles and block DnD operate on one editor surface (no nested side-menu conflict)
- `cardRef` / `toggleListInlineView` are childless embed blocks at persistence boundaries: parser/adapter/serializer normalize away direct children so NFM always stores them as self-contained tags (`toggleListInlineView` persists `rules-v2="..."` when explicit rules are present, otherwise current defaults apply in-memory).
- Dropping host-document blocks onto a `toggleListInlineView` owner/root boundary creates cards in the inline view's source project instead of nesting blocks under the embed; target status/index are inferred from pointed row neighbors and active rank/filter rules (best-effort)
- Projected row roots are structure-guarded for manual insert/delete/reorder, but dragging a projected row root out to host-doc scope materializes it into a standalone `cardToggle` and deletes the source card using source-project metadata (works for same-project and cross-project projected sources); child blocks inside projected rows remain freely draggable in/out
- Inline block recursion is guarded: nested same-source inline views render an infinity placeholder (`∞`) instead of expanding recursively
- Drag-handle block menu includes a `Send blocks` submenu with `Append to card...` and `Turn into cards...`; both remove the selected source blocks (move semantics), and persist grouped history updates for affected card descriptions/creates
- Drag handles, formatting toolbar, block selection
- Delete card action
- View history button opens a card-specific overlay timeline for the currently open Card Stage card
- History panel supports operation filters, keyboard/list navigation, and entry-level detailed views (update before/after field diffs, move from/to columns, create/delete snapshots)

#### 8. Edit History & Undo/Redo
- Full edit history tracked in SQLite `history` table
- Session-scoped undo stacks (each renderer/browser tab has independent history)
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Cmd+Z` (undo), `Cmd+Shift+Z` (redo) — see `docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md` for full reference
- Operations tracked: create, update, delete, move
- Grouped undo/redo is supported via `history.group_id` so one undo can revert a multi-step atomic action (for example: block-drop import creates + source updates)
- Non-description fields use delta storage (only changed fields stored, not full snapshots)
- Card descriptions are stored outside `history` in a revision chain keyed by `cards.description_revision_id`; history rows only store description revision pointers
- Description revisions use top-level NFM block hashing plus ordered splice deltas, with periodic snapshot revisions to cap reconstruction work
- Current builds do not support opening older pre-revision SQLite schemas in-app; recreate the local database if you need a fresh store on a newer build
- History panel is card-scoped (opened as an overlay from Card Stage) and shows a per-card edit timeline with timestamps, plus selectable detail panes for field diffs and snapshots
- The card history overlay reads a panel-specific display model from `history:card` instead of reusing the old generic `HistoryEntry` payload
- Description changes in the history panel render as top-level NFM block operations (`added`, `removed`, `replaced`) with per-block previews and optional raw block source, not hydrated whole-document before/after blobs
- Each description-delta entry also includes a default-collapsed full diff viewer so users can inspect the entire description state when the block summary is not enough
- Create/delete entries show description snapshots as ordered top-level block cards with previews and expandable block source
- History retention is configurable from Settings -> Backups; the value is per-project row count, and `0` disables pruning
- History panel is resizable (640–1400px, default 960px) with width persisted in localStorage
- Detailed storage and migration rules for revision-based description history: [Description History Revisions](./description-history-revisions.md)
- **Revert single change**: Undo a specific history entry (update, move, create, or delete) — creates a new forward history entry so the revert is itself visible and reversible
- **Restore to point**: Time-travel a card to any historical state by reconstructing from creation snapshot + forward deltas; applies field updates and column moves as needed
- Action buttons shown in entry detail view with inline confirmation flow; disabled for undo meta-entries
- Card stage auto-refreshes card state after history mutations via `onCardMutated` callback
- Toast notifications after undo/redo actions

#### 9. Whole-Store Backups
- Manual backup creation via CLI/API (`kanban.db` + `assets/`)
- Automatic backups every 6 hours with retention of latest 28 auto backups
- Restore requires explicit confirmation and creates a pre-restore safety backup by default
- Backup artifacts are stored under `~/.nodex/backups/<backup-id>/` with a versioned `manifest.json`

#### 10. Canvas View (Excalidraw)
- Canvas tab provides a freeform whiteboard per project for card brainstorming and visual mapping.
- Scene persistence stores Excalidraw `elements`, `appState`, and `files` so embedded images survive reloads/project switches.
- Canvas payload supports image-heavy scenes up to 20 MB over HTTP transport.
- Canvas saves are flushed on page lifecycle transitions and during app-window close handshake to reduce lost edits when quitting.

#### 11. Calendar View
- Calendar tab shows scheduled cards in a day-grid timeline (4-day or week view).
- Calendar has a dedicated all-day lane above the timed grid, and all-day cards render only in that lane.
- Multi-day all-day cards render as one horizontal span across covered day columns using end-exclusive day range semantics.
- All-day lane overflow is vertical-scrollable.
- A draggable separator between all-day lane and timed grid resizes lane height; height preference persists per project and day-count view in localStorage.
- The separator is keyboard-accessible (`ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` with `Home`/`End` bounds) and exposed as an ARIA horizontal separator.
- Timeline hour height auto-fits to available panel height with a minimum readable hour height.
- `Shift + mouse wheel` navigates by one day per step as a smooth rolling window (including week view), without requiring toolbar clicks.
- In Calendar view, `Shift + mouse wheel` is handled by the calendar surface first (including the calendar toolbar), and does not trigger stage switching or stage-rail horizontal scrolling.
- Users can drag existing calendar cards to move them across visible days and times while preserving duration.
- Calendar move-drag uses native drag lifecycle, so the drag ghost follows the pointer across the desktop (including when leaving the app window).
- Dragging supports timed/all-day conversion:
  - Timed -> all-day: sets `isAllDay=true`, snaps start to local midnight of target day, and preserves span as `ceil(duration/24h)` days (minimum 1).
  - All-day -> timed: sets `isAllDay=false`, drops at target slot time, preserves meaningful sub-day duration when available, otherwise uses 1 hour fallback.
- During an active drag move, target feedback is region-specific:
  - Timed target: source card stays ghosted at origin while a timed ghost preview is shown in-grid.
  - All-day target: source card stays ghosted at origin while an all-day ghost span appears in the all-day lane.
  - Outside calendar target: a cancel indicator appears and dropping does not change schedule.
- Side-by-side lane width is driven by peak simultaneous overlap within a connected overlap chain, so transitive-only neighbors do not create phantom extra lanes.
- Users can resize scheduled ranges by dragging the top or bottom edge of a calendar card; updates snap to 15-minute slots.
- Calendar rendering is occurrence-based (`calendar:occurrences`) so recurring cards expand into time-windowed event instances.
- Calendar event cards display a repeat indicator on occurrences derived from recurring cards, with a distinct icon for the first occurrence in each series.
- Card Stage exposes repeat settings (frequency, interval, weekly weekdays, inclusive end date), reminder offsets, and schedule timezone.
- Users can complete or skip a specific occurrence from Calendar quick actions and from Card Stage.
- Completing an occurrence creates a new snapshot card with status `done` and `archived=true`; archived events remain visible on Calendar with muted styling.
- Recurrence logs are not exposed in product UI or API.
- Occurrence schedule edits support scope: `this`, `this-and-future` (series split), and `all`.
- For recurring event drag/resize from Calendar, the app prompts with explicit scope choices before persisting. On the first occurrence in the current series, it shows `Only this occurrence` and `All occurrences`; on non-first occurrences, it shows `Only this occurrence` and `This and future`.
- Choosing `Only this occurrence` detaches that occurrence into a standalone non-recurring card while the original series skips that occurrence.
- Choosing `This and future` trims the original series to end the day before the selected occurrence and creates a new series from the selected occurrence onward; when selected on the first occurrence, it behaves like `All occurrences` (no split).
- For drag-based recurrence schedule moves (`All occurrences` and `This and future`), if the series has an inclusive end date (`untilDate`), that date shifts by the same calendar-day delta as the dragged occurrence so series length is preserved.
- Desktop reminders fire while the app is running, include startup/resume catch-up, and notification click deep-links to the target card Card Stage.

#### 12. Codex Threads (Electron-only in this phase)
- New threads are created from a card and linked immediately to that card.
- Thread creation requires the first user prompt and immediately starts the first turn.
- New threads auto-generate a concise title from the first user prompt using `scripts/generate-thread-title.md` (`gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, reasoning effort `low`) unless an explicit thread name is provided.
- Thread stage always includes a persistent `New thread` tab.
- In Card Stage `Threads`, pressing `New` focuses the Thread stage `New thread` tab (no inline Card Stage prompt composer).
- The `New thread` tab shows the selected project/card context and uses the stage composer for the first prompt.
- Card `Run in` defaults to `Local project`, so new threads run in `runInLocalPath` (when set) or the project workspace path.
- `New worktree` run target creates a managed Git worktree under `${serverDir}/worktrees/<rand4>/<project-id>` and links thread cwd to that worktree.
- For `New worktree`, first thread creation persists the managed worktree path on the card (`runInWorktreePath`), and subsequent new threads for that card reuse it.
- If the persisted managed worktree path is missing/invalid (for example deleted outside Nodex), thread start recreates a managed worktree and overwrites `runInWorktreePath`.
- For `New worktree` before first creation (no persisted `runInWorktreePath`), Card Stage shows an environment selector populated from `<workspace>/.codex/environments/*.toml`, with a `No environment` option and an `Environment settings` action that opens `<workspace>/.codex/environments` in the file manager.
- If `runInEnvironmentPath` is selected and points to a valid `.toml` file with `[setup].script`, that script runs in the newly created managed worktree before `thread/start`.
- Environment setup failure aborts thread creation, does not persist `runInWorktreePath`, and best-effort removes the just-created managed worktree.
- During `New worktree` creation, the `New thread` panel shows a real-time setup log view (`Creating a worktree and running setup.`) with streamed progress from worktree creation and setup script output.
- Reusing an existing persisted `runInWorktreePath` does not re-run environment setup.
- Settings -> `Worktrees` shows managed inventory deduplicated by resolved worktree path (reused paths appear once).
- Settings -> `Worktrees` delete removes the managed directory (prefer `git worktree remove --force` when metadata is available, otherwise recursive delete) and unlinks all thread links that target the same managed path.
- Card Stage `Threads` row shows a `Reset worktree` control when reusing a persisted path; reset clears `runInWorktreePath` so the next thread creates a fresh managed worktree.
- Worktree base branch resolution order is: remote HEAD symbolic ref, then `main`, then `master`, then current branch, then first available local branch.
- Global worktree creation mode is configurable in Settings -> `Worktrees`: `Auto branch` (creates `<prefix><thread-slug>`; default prefix is `nodex/`, and thread slug is derived from the thread title by lowercasing, keeping the first 5 words, stripping non-`[a-z0-9]`, then joining with `-`) or `Detached HEAD` (default).
- `Cloud` run target is explicitly blocked in both renderer preflight and backend thread-start validation in this release.
- Sending from `New thread` creates the thread and switches focus to the newly created thread tab.
- As soon as a turn starts, the transcript shows the submitted user prompt optimistically and keeps that bubble visible above the pending `Waiting for response…` state until live response items arrive; when the live user-message item later arrives, it is deduped instead of rendering twice.
- Threads can navigate back to the owning card (`Open card`) from the Thread stage.
- Running threads keep syncing in the background when users switch to another thread tab; returning to the running tab preserves live state (including stop affordance and existing tool-call logs).
- Thread tabs show a running indicator for actively executing threads.
- Sidebar thread entries (and the Threads group icon) switch to a running indicator while execution is active.
- In-app account UX supports account read, ChatGPT/API-key login, login cancel, logout, and a `Connected` tooltip that refreshes on reveal and shows the remaining primary/secondary rate-limit windows when available.
- Approval policy is per-project: `auto` by default, with optional `manual` mode in Thread stage.
- Thread stage composer exposes real Codex model and reasoning-effort selectors; selections persist globally in local storage and are applied to the first turn of new threads and subsequent turns.
- Thread stage composer exposes collaboration mode presets (`Default`, `Plan`) sourced from app-server `collaborationMode/list` with a client fallback to `Default` + `Plan` when unavailable.
- Collaboration mode selection is persisted locally per thread context (`thread:<threadId>`) and per new-thread draft context (`draft:<projectId>:<cardId>`), with draft selection migrated to the created thread after first-turn creation.
- Thread and turn start requests include `collaborationMode` when selected; `Plan` mode enables clarifying-question flows through `item/tool/requestUserInput`.
- Multi-question `request_user_input` cards preserve keyboard continuity: using `Left` / `Right` to move between questions keeps focus on the next question's equivalent answer control instead of dropping focus out of the card, and option questions let `ArrowDown` move from the last preset choice into the free-form row while `ArrowUp` at the start of that free-form field returns to the preset choices.
- Thread stage composer also shows the real Git branch for the effective thread `cwd` (falling back to the project workspace path), and that branch chip auto-refreshes when the current worktree switches branches outside the app.
- Threads composer uses one round icon button: it sends when idle, shows a spinner immediately while the prompt send is pending, and switches to a stop icon while Codex is running so users can interrupt immediately.
- Threads composer send shortcut defaults to `Enter` (with `Shift+Enter` for newline) and is user-configurable in Settings -> Editor -> `Thread send shortcut` (`Enter` or `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`).
- Absolute local file links rendered anywhere in the app (for example `/workspace/project/file.ts#L71`) open in the configured desktop app instead of falling through as raw browser/file URLs, and the original click is consumed so editor widgets do not also open the same href in a browser tab/window. In Codex thread markdown, hovering those links shows an immediate tooltip with the full local path and resolved line/column when present.
- `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` and `item/fileChange/requestApproval` auto-accept in `auto` mode.
- `item/tool/requestUserInput` always requires explicit user input in UI.
- `item/plan/delta` streams incremental plan content; both `text` and `markdownText` stay in sync during reducer updates for markdown-first rendering.
- `serverRequest/resolved` clears stale pending approval and user-input queue entries by request id.
- Codex thread items are normalized into structured renderer data (`normalizedKind`, optional `toolCall`, optional `markdownText`, optional `rawItem`, optional lifecycle `status`). Top-level duplicate fields such as `text`, `command`, `cwd`, and `aggregatedOutput` are not part of the normalized shape.
- Assistant, plan, and reasoning content render through Streamdown with official code, Mermaid, math, and CJK plugins, plus streaming-safe parsing for in-progress turns and Nodex-specific local-file link handling.
- Reasoning (`Thinking`) items stay visible while in progress and are hidden after completion by default; users can keep completed reasoning visible by disabling Settings -> Editor -> `Hide thinking when done`.
- Tool activity renders as structured expandable cards instead of plain text dumps: specialized cards for command execution, file changes, MCP, and web search, plus a generic fallback card that always exposes args/result/error/raw payloads for unknown future tool types.
- Tool-call header labels use a two-tone hierarchy for scanability: the leading action phrase (for example, `Explored`, `Searched web`, `Ran`) is emphasized over trailing detail text.
- Command execution cards consume parsed `commandActions` metadata (`read`, `listFiles`, `search`) to show exploration summaries (for example, `Explored 4 files, 1 search`) and per-action transcript rows (`Read`, `Listed`, `Searched`).
- Consecutive exploration-only command execution items in the same turn are coalesced into one transcript card before render so exploration activity is summarized as a single grouped entry.
- While the current turn is still active, the trailing coalesced exploration section remains visually `in progress` (`Exploring` shimmer) until a non-exploration item appears in that same turn or the turn stops.
- Exploration sections are expanded by default only while they are `in progress`; once exploration settles, they collapse by default.
- Command execution headers show `in <cwd>` only when the command ran outside the active project's workspace path.
- Tool-call transcript state is recovered from persisted Codex session history when available, with a SQLite snapshot fallback while a rollout has not materialized yet, so existing tool logs survive thread tab switches and app restarts without Nodex owning a second durable transcript copy.
- Browser/HTTP transport returns explicit unsupported errors for `codex:*` methods in this release.

### Statuses

| 2 | backlog | Backlog | Refined tasks ready to queue up |
| 3 | in_progress | In Progress | Currently being worked on |
| 4 | in_review | In Review | Awaiting review or verification |
| 5 | done | Done | Finished work |

`archived` is an orthogonal internal flag. Archived cards are not rendered in the Kanban board, sidebar status groups, or toggle-list defaults.

### Real-Time Sync Flow

**Electron path (IPC):**
```
Database Write → EventEmitter (notifier) → mainWindow.webContents.send()
    → window.api.on("board-changed") → useKanban hook → UI re-renders
```

**Browser path (HTTP + SSE):**
```
Database Write → EventEmitter (notifier) → SSE push (Hono /events endpoint)
    → EventSource listener → useKanban hook → UI re-renders
```

The transport layer (`src/renderer/lib/api.ts`) auto-detects the runtime and uses the appropriate path. In Electron, renderer HTTP routes resolve from a preload-injected server URL; in browser mode they resolve from same-origin (with localhost Vite dev fallback to default API port `51283`). SSE events are scoped per project.

Codex Threads emit a separate Electron IPC stream (`codex:event`) from the main-process Codex domain service; browser mode intentionally does not provide Codex parity in this phase.

## CLI Reference

The `nodex` binary serves two roles: starting the server and running agent commands.

### Server Commands

```bash
nodex                            # Start server with defaults
nodex serve [path] [-p port]     # Explicit server start
nodex serve --dev                # Development mode
```

Server options:
- `[kanban-path]` - Path to kanban directory (default: `~/.nodex`)
- `-p, --port <port>` - Port to run on (default: 51283)
- `--dev` - Run in development mode with hot reload

### Project Commands

```bash
nodex projects                          # List all projects
nodex projects add <id> <name>          # Create a project
nodex projects mv <old-id> <new-id>     # Rename a project (updates all references)
nodex projects rm <id>                  # Delete a project (and all its data)
```

### Config Commands

```bash
nodex config                     # Edit config interactively
nodex config show                # Show resolved config with sources
nodex config show --json         # JSON output
```

### Agent Commands

```bash
nodex ls [column]                # List cards (all or by column)
nodex get <card-id>              # Get card details (auto-resolves column)
nodex add <column> <title>       # Create card
nodex update <card-id> [opts]    # Update card (minimal output; -v for full details)
nodex rm <card-id>               # Delete card (auto-resolves column)
nodex mv <card-id> <from> <to> [order] [opts] # Move card (atomic claim)
nodex history [--card <id>]      # View edit history
nodex undo                       # Undo last operation
nodex redo                       # Redo last undone
nodex query "<sql>" [params...]  # Run read-only SQL query
nodex schema                     # Show database schema
nodex backups [subcommand]       # List/create/restore backups
# Aliases: list/show/create/remove/delete/move/hist
```

Agent command options:
- `-p, --project <id>` - Project to operate on (default: "default")
- `--url <url>` - Server URL override
- `--session-id <id>` - Session ID for undo/redo tracking
- `--jsonl` - Output JSON Lines (default)
- `--json` - Output JSON array/object
- `--csv` - Output CSV
- `--pretty` - Pretty-print JSON output (use with `--json`)
- `--table` - Output aligned plain-text tables
- `-v, --verbose` - Verbose output (e.g. full card details after update)
- `-d, --description <text>` - Card description (supports `@file` / `@-` for stdin)
- `-P, --priority <p>` - Priority level
- `-e, --estimate <e>` - Size estimate
- `-t, --tags <t1,t2>` - Comma-separated tags
- `-a, --assignee <name>` - Assignee
- `--yes` - Required confirmation flag for destructive backup restore
- `--no-safety-backup` - Skip automatic pre-restore safety backup
- `--label <text>` - Optional backup label for `nodex backups create`
- `--clear-description` - Clear description (update/mv)
- `--clear-tags` - Clear tags (update/mv)
- `--clear-assignee` - Clear assignee (update/mv)
- `--clear-due` - Clear due date (update/mv)
- `--clear-agent-status` - Clear agent status (update/mv)
- `--no-agent-blocked` - Clear blocked state (update/mv)
- `--full` - Include full card fields in `ls`
- `--description-chars <n>` - Truncate `ls --full` descriptions to `n` chars (default: 240)
- `--description-full` - Include full description in `ls --full`

CLI parsing is strict: unknown options and invalid enum/date values fail fast with actionable errors.

Status args accept canonical ids plus ergonomic separator aliases such as `in-progress` -> `in_progress` and `in-review` -> `in_review`.

### Backup Commands

```bash
nodex backups                                   # List backups
nodex backups create [--label <text>]           # Create manual backup
nodex backups restore <backup-id> --yes         # Restore backup with safety backup
nodex backups restore <backup-id> --yes --no-safety-backup
```

### File/Stdin Input

Text fields (`--description`, `--agent-status`, `--title`) support reading from files or stdin:

```bash
nodex add backlog "Task" -d @./plan.md        # Read from file
cat spec.md | nodex add backlog "Task" -d @-  # Read from stdin
```

---

## Configuration

### Config File: `.nodex/config.toml`

TOML config for both agent and server settings. Resolution order (later wins):
1. Defaults
2. `~/.nodex/config.toml` (user-level, auto-generated if no config exists)
3. `.nodex/config.toml` walked up from CWD (project-level overrides user-level)
4. Env vars: `NODEX_*` for agent, `KANBAN_*` for server
5. CLI flags: `--url`, `--session-id`, `--project`, `--port`, `[path]`

```toml
# .nodex/config.toml
url = "http://localhost:51283"
session_id = "my-agent"
project = "default"

[server]
dir = "~/.nodex"
port = 51283
backup_auto_enabled = false
backup_interval_hours = 6
backup_retention = 28
history_retention = 1000
```

**Dev/production separation**: Use project-level `.nodex/config.toml` for dev settings (different port/dir) and `~/.nodex/config.toml` for production. When running `nodex --dev` from a project directory, the project-level config takes priority. When the Electron app is launched directly (e.g., from Dock), only `~/.nodex/config.toml` is read.

**Electron renderer API base resolution**: Main process resolves server port from the same config chain (`config.toml` + env), starts HTTP server on that port, and injects `serverUrl` through preload. Renderer HTTP helpers (including image upload and asset URL resolution) consume this runtime URL so `[server].port` changes are honored; browser mode uses same-origin except local Vite dev (`:51284`) which falls back to default API port (`:51283`).

### Server Environment Variables
```bash
KANBAN_DIR=~/.nodex     # Kanban directory (default: ~/.nodex)
KANBAN_PORT=51283        # Port (default: 51283)
KANBAN_BACKUP_AUTO_ENABLED=false   # Enable auto backups (default: false)
KANBAN_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=6    # Auto backup interval in hours (default: 6)
KANBAN_BACKUP_RETENTION=28        # Auto backup retention count (default: 28)
KANBAN_HISTORY_RETENTION=1000    # Max history entries per project (default: 1000, 0 = unlimited)
```

These can also be set via the `[server]` section in config.toml. Env vars override TOML values.

In the desktop app, Settings -> Backups updates `~/.nodex/config.toml` `[server]` backup fields and reapplies the auto-backup scheduler immediately. If `KANBAN_BACKUP_*` environment variables are set, those values remain effective and the UI marks the overridden fields.

In the desktop app, Settings -> Workspace -> `App updates` updates the user-level `~/.nodex/config.toml` `[server].app_updates_auto_check_enabled` flag. Browser mode and unpackaged/non-macOS runtimes report updater support as unavailable and do not perform background checks.

### Agent Environment Variables
```bash
NODEX_URL=http://localhost:51283
NODEX_SESSION_ID=my-agent
NODEX_PROJECT=default
```

Environment variables can be passed directly. CLI arguments take precedence.

### Development
```bash
bun install
bun run dev              # electron-vite dev (renderer on :51284, HTTP API on :51283)
```

### Production
```bash
bun run build            # electron-vite build → out/
bun run start            # electron out/main/index.js
```

### Packaging & Release
```bash
bun run package          # Build + create macOS DMG + ZIP in dist/
```

To release a new version, use the GitHub Actions `Prepare Release` workflow:
```bash
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md under ## [Unreleased]
# 2. Trigger "Prepare Release" in GitHub Actions or from the CLI:
gh workflow run "Prepare Release" \
  --repo junyudev/nodex \
  -f release_type=patch
# 3. The workflow runs typecheck/lint/tests, prepares an unpushed release
#    candidate, and signs/notarizes arm64 + x64 builds from that candidate.
# 4. Only after both macOS builds pass does it commit, tag, push, publish the
#    GitHub Release, and update junyudev/homebrew-tap.
```

Detailed CI behavior, job responsibilities, secrets, artifact naming, and recovery steps live in `docs/release-macos.md`.

## Agent Integration

### Design: CLI + REST API

Agents use the **`nodex` CLI** for all board operations. The CLI wraps the REST API with ergonomic commands, strict option/value validation, auto-column-resolution, and config file support. The REST API remains available for direct HTTP access.

### How Agents Use the Board

```bash
# 1. Read backlog tasks (uses default project, or set --project)
nodex ls backlog

# 2. Claim a task atomically (fails if another agent already claimed it)
nodex mv abc1234 backlog in-progress --agent-status "Starting work..."

# 3. Update status while working
nodex update abc1234 --agent-status "Running tests..."

# 4. Mark as blocked if stuck
nodex update abc1234 --agent-blocked --agent-status "Blocked: Need API credentials"

# 5. Complete task - move to review
nodex mv abc1234 in-progress in-review --agent-status "Ready for review"

# Working with a specific project
nodex --project my-app ls backlog
nodex --project my-app add backlog "New feature"

# Create a manual safety snapshot before risky changes
nodex backups create --label "before release refactor"

# Restore full board state (db + assets)
nodex backups restore <backup-id> --yes
```

### CLI vs REST API

| Action | CLI Command | REST API |
|--------|------------|----------|
| List projects | `nodex projects` | GET `/api/projects` |
| Create project | `nodex projects add <id> <name>` | POST `/api/projects` |
| Rename project | `nodex projects mv <old> <new>` | PUT `/api/projects/[projectId]` |
| Delete project | `nodex projects rm <id>` | DELETE `/api/projects/[projectId]` |
| List cards | `nodex ls [status]` | GET `/api/projects/[projectId]/board` |
| Get card | `nodex get <id>` | GET `/api/projects/[projectId]/card?cardId=Y` |
| Create card | `nodex add <status> <title>` | POST `/api/projects/[projectId]/board` |
| Update card | `nodex update <id> [opts]` | PUT `/api/projects/[projectId]/card` |
| Delete card | `nodex rm <id>` | DELETE `/api/projects/[projectId]/card?cardId=Y` |
| Move card | `nodex mv <id> <from> <to> [opts]` | PUT `/api/projects/[projectId]/move` (atomic: 409 if card not in `fromStatus`) + optional PUT `/api/projects/[projectId]/card` (property updates) |
| History | `nodex history` | GET `/api/projects/[projectId]/history` |
| Undo/Redo | `nodex undo` / `nodex redo` | POST `/api/projects/[projectId]/undo` / `redo` |
| SQL query | `nodex query "<sql>"` | POST `/api/projects/[projectId]/query` |
| Schema | `nodex schema` | GET `/api/projects/[projectId]/schema` |
| List backups | `nodex backups` | GET `/api/backups` |
| Create backup | `nodex backups create` | POST `/api/backups` |
| Restore backup | `nodex backups restore <id> --yes` | POST `/api/backups/[backupId]/restore` |

The server auto-resolves `status` for get/update/delete, so agents only need the card ID. `mv` requires explicit `<from> <to>` statuses for atomic claim semantics (409 if the card already moved). Each CLI command issues a single HTTP request (no pre-lookup), eliminating TOCTOU races when multiple agents operate concurrently.

### Output Format

All CLI output is **JSON Lines by default** (machine-readable, one object per line). Use `--json` for JSON array/object output, `--csv` for CSV, or `--table` for aligned plain-text tables.

```bash
nodex ls backlog            # JSONL (one card object per line)
nodex get abc1234 --json    # JSON object
nodex ls backlog --csv      # CSV table
nodex ls backlog --table    # aligned plain-text table
nodex ls backlog --full     # full card fields + truncated description
nodex ls backlog --full --description-full  # full description
nodex ls --offset 10 --limit 10      # paginate (skip 10, take 10)
```

### SQL Query Examples

```bash
# Count cards by status
nodex query "SELECT status, archived, COUNT(*) as count FROM cards GROUP BY status, archived"

# Find high-priority blocked cards
nodex query "SELECT * FROM cards WHERE priority IN (?, ?) AND agent_blocked = 1" p0-critical p1-high

# Search by title pattern
nodex query "SELECT * FROM cards WHERE title LIKE ?" "%bug%"
```

**Security:** Only SELECT queries are allowed (enforced via SQLite's `Statement.readonly`). Parameters are positional (`?` placeholders).

---

## Design Decisions

### Why SQLite?
- **Atomic transactions**: Move operations are atomic, no data corruption
- **Fast queries**: Indexed lookups, no file parsing overhead
- **Single file**: Easy to backup, restore, or move
- **No server**: Embedded database, no separate process needed
- **WAL mode**: Good concurrent read performance

### Why Multi-Project in One Database?
- **Single file**: One `kanban.db` contains all projects, easy to manage
- **Foreign keys with CASCADE**: Deleting a project automatically cleans up all related data
- **Shared schema**: No duplicate table definitions across databases
- **Atomic cross-project queries**: SQL can query across projects if needed

### Why Electron?
- Desktop app with native window management
- Preload script provides secure IPC bridge via contextBridge
- Main process hosts both SQLite and HTTP server in one long-lived process
- No need for globalThis singleton hacks (unlike Next.js server)
- Browser fallback: UI also works at `http://localhost:51284` via HTTP fetch

### Why Dual Transport (IPC + HTTP)?
- **Electron (IPC)**: Fast, no network overhead, no CORS concerns
- **Browser (HTTP)**: Allows accessing the board from any browser without Electron
- Transport abstraction (`api.ts`) makes this transparent to hooks/components
- Renderer HTTP base is runtime-aware: preload-injected `serverUrl` in Electron, same-origin in browser (with local Vite dev fallback to `:51283`)
- SSE provides real-time updates in browser mode; IPC events in Electron mode
- Renderer dedupes realtime fan-out by project: one shared board subscription/fetch path updates all `useKanban` consumers in that project

### Why SSE for Browser Mode?
- Simpler implementation for one-way updates
- Automatic reconnection
- No additional dependencies

### Why Local Database?
- No server setup required
- Easy to inspect with any SQLite client
- Portable single file
- Works offline

### Why SQLite Online Backup API for Backups?
- **WAL-safe snapshots**: `db.backup(...)` captures consistent state from a live WAL database
- **Atomic backup directories**: Stage in temp dir and rename into place
- **Restore safety**: Auto pre-restore safety backup and rollback staging protect against failed restores
- **Whole-store recovery**: Backups include both `kanban.db` and `assets/`

### Why Stable Asset URIs?
- **Port-independent storage**: NFM descriptions stay valid even if server host/port changes
- **Flat asset ids**: canonical asset references use `nodex://assets/<file>` so image blocks stay portable while file lookup remains a simple single-directory join
- **Simple rendering**: URI resolves to HTTP route in editor (`resolveFileUrl`) and read-only renderer
- **Safer lifecycle**: Deferred cleanup avoids accidental data loss from aggressive orphan deletion

### Why CLI for Agents?
- **Ergonomic**: `nodex mv abc1234 5 6` vs multi-line curl commands
- **Concurrency-safe**: Server-side column resolution means each CLI command is a single atomic HTTP request — no TOCTOU races when multiple agents operate simultaneously
- **Auto-resolution**: Agents don't need to track card column IDs
- **Strict parsing**: Unknown flags/invalid values fail fast instead of silently being ignored
- **Flexible output**: JSONL by default, plus `--json`, `--csv`, and human-friendly `--table`
- **Config files**: TOML config at `.nodex/config.toml` avoids repeating `--url`
- **File input**: `@file` / `@-` for uploading plans or descriptions
- **REST API still available**: CLI wraps the API; direct HTTP access remains for advanced use

### Why REST API?
- **Consistent interface**: Same HTTP patterns for all operations
- **JSON responses**: No database queries required by agents
- **Granular reads**: Fetch just one column or card instead of entire board

### Why Write Limits in App Layer?
- **Stops runaway growth early**: Field-level validation blocks exponential-content bugs before they hit SQLite/history
- **Transport parity**: `db-service` validation protects both HTTP and Electron IPC writes
- **Resource protection**: Route-level body caps reject oversized requests with `413` before JSON parsing/DB work
- **Operational simplicity**: Limits live in shared constants, so values stay consistent across modules

### Why Popper Positioning for Inline Creator Selects?
- **Radix compatibility with custom triggers**: Avoids `item-aligned` dependence on `SelectValue` value-node measurement
- **Reliable placement**: Dropdown menus anchor consistently in narrow kanban columns
- **Safer click-outside behavior**: Portaled menu interactions can be excluded from inline creator auto-dismiss logic
- **Safe writes**: API ensures valid data, agents can't corrupt database
- **Race condition safety**: Transactions handle concurrent writes properly

### Why Shared Slash-Menu Controller?
- **Single extension point**: Add custom block insertions (like `toggleListInlineView`) while preserving BlockNote default slash items
- **Consistent UX across editors**: Card Stage and Toggle-List editor use the same slash composition and filtering behavior
- **Avoid duplicate overlays**: Explicitly disabling built-in `slashMenu` prevents stacked/default menu conflicts

### Why Shared Toggle-List Card Editor Core?
- **DRY behavior parity**: Toggle List tab and inline toggle-list embeds use one implementation for schema setup, structural guards, and card sync
- **Navigation correctness**: Boundary Up/Down routing is centralized around native `cardToggle` summaries and host callbacks, reducing `NodeSelection`/DOM-race edge cases
- **Safer maintenance**: Fixes to sync/debounce/rules apply once instead of drifting across duplicated editor implementations

### Why Schema-Gated Child-Group Keyboard Overrides?
- **Broader consistency**: One Enter/Backspace policy works for all inline parent blocks with children, not just toggle-type parents
- **Safer scope**: Schema-gating (`content: "inline"`) avoids applying text merge/split semantics to non-inline wrappers
- **Deterministic precedence**: Enter extension declares `runsBefore` list-item shortcut extensions so custom child-group behavior intercepts before built-in list item Enter handlers
- **Consistent child merge**: Backspace at the start of any leaf child under an inline parent always merges that child upward, regardless of whether it is the tail child
- **Stable caret behavior**: ProseMirror-level split/merge helpers set cursor positions in one transaction, avoiding cursor drift from multi-step high-level updates

### Why TOML for Server Config?
- **Unified config**: Agent and server settings in one file, one resolution chain
- **Dev/production split**: Project-level `.nodex/config.toml` for dev, `~/.nodex/config.toml` for production
- **Direct launch support**: Electron app reads `~/.nodex/config.toml` without needing env vars
- **CLI bridge**: `cmdServe()` resolves TOML (with CWD walk-up) and passes final values as env vars to the Electron child process, since the child's CWD is `packageRoot`

### Why Session-Scoped Undo?
- **Independent tabs**: Each browser tab has its own undo stack
- **No conflicts**: Users can't accidentally undo each other's changes
- **Simple mental model**: "My undo undoes my actions"
- **Persisted in DB**: History survives page refresh (sessionStorage holds session ID)

### Why Delta Storage for History?
- **Space efficient**: Only store changed fields, not full card snapshots
- **Fast queries**: Smaller records = faster reads
- **Exception for delete**: Full snapshot stored to enable recreation
- **Card ID preserved**: Deleted cards restore with same ID

### Why BlockNote for the Editor?
- **Notion-like UX out of the box**: Drag handles, slash menu, block selection, formatting toolbar
- **Native block nesting**: Children blocks are first-class (crucial for NFM's tab-indented structure)
- **Built on ProseMirror/Tiptap**: Battle-tested engine, active development
- **Custom block types**: `createReactBlockSpec` for callout blocks (extensible for future types)
- **shadcn/ui integration**: `@blocknote/shadcn` uses the same UI primitives as the rest of the app

### Why Notion-Flavored Markdown (NFM)?
- **Notion compatibility**: Same format used by Notion API, enabling future integrations
- **Block-level structure**: Tab indentation for children, `{color="Color"}` attributes, XML-like advanced blocks
- **Editor-local indentation boundaries**: If `Tab` or `Shift+Tab` cannot change nesting, the keystroke is swallowed instead of moving focus into hover-only editor chrome
- **Human-readable**: Descriptions remain readable in raw text (CLI, database inspection)
- **Custom parser/serializer**: Pure functions in `src/renderer/lib/nfm/`, independent of editor library
- **Three-layer architecture**: NFM string ↔ NfmBlock tree ↔ BlockNote blocks — clean separation of concerns
- **Read-only renderer**: Card previews use `NfmRenderer` (lightweight, no editor overhead)
