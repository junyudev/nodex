# Keyboard Shortcuts

All keyboard shortcuts in Nodex. Platform modifier: **⌘ (Cmd)** on Mac, **Ctrl** on Windows/Linux.

## App-Wide

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Next stage | Cycles `DB -> Cards -> Threads -> Diff`, including while focus is inside the NFM editor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Previous stage | Reverse cycle, including while focus is inside the NFM editor |
| `⌘/Ctrl+L` | Next stage | Alias for next-stage navigation; same editable-target behavior as stage cycling shortcuts |
| `⌘/Ctrl+H` | Previous stage | Alias for previous-stage navigation; same editable-target behavior as stage cycling shortcuts |
| `Shift+Wheel` | Scroll stage rail panels | Uses native horizontal wheel scrolling in the stage rail; does not change stage focus (Calendar view claims this gesture for day navigation and blocks stage-rail scrolling) |
| `⌘/Ctrl+1`–`4` | Jump to stage by index | Stage index order in sidebar; works while focus is in the NFM editor |
| `⌘/Ctrl+Alt+1`–`9` | Jump to space by index | First 9 spaces in sidebar order (disabled while focus is in NFM editor because `⌘/Ctrl+Alt+1`–`4` are editor heading shortcuts) |
| `⌘/Ctrl+Shift+P` | Open project/space picker | Opens space manager popover, including while focus is inside the NFM editor |
| `⌘/Ctrl+K` | Open command palette | Global launcher for cards and commands; works from editable surfaces too |
| `⌘/Ctrl+P` | Open command palette | Alias for the same global launcher |
| `⌘/Ctrl+,` | Toggle settings overlay | Opens/closes the full-page settings overlay |
| `⌘/Ctrl+J` | Toggle bottom terminal panel | Global toggle, including when focus is in editor inputs |
