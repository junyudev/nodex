# Landing Site

This document is the source of truth for the public Nodex landing site and its GitHub Pages deployment path.

## Overview

The landing site lives in `packages/landing`. Astro generates its static pages, with React islands for interactive content and Tailwind v4 for styling. It stays separate from the Electron renderer and its design-token stack.

Why it is separate:

- the site is published to `https://nodex.jyu.app`
- it should stay fast and low-risk
- it should not inherit desktop-app-only code, CSS, or runtime assumptions

The source of truth stays in this repository. Published static output is pushed to the separate org-site repository `NodexApp/NodexApp.github.io`.

## Local Commands

Run these from the repo root:

```bash
vp run dev:landing
vp run build:landing
vp run preview:landing
vp run --filter @nodex/landing test
```

Astro owns the development server, production build, and preview server. The root
commands delegate to the landing package through Vite+. Its Vite plugins use the
workspace's Vite+ alias. The focused tests run an isolated production build and
check the generated pages and public assets. They run from the repository root
because the shared Vitest setup resolves generated Markdown assets from that directory.

## Package Layout

`packages/landing` contains:

- `astro.config.ts` for static output, React islands, and the Tailwind Vite plugin
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` for metadata, font preloads, and system theme detection
- `src/pages/index.astro` for the homepage
- `src/pages/changelog/index.astro` for the generated changelog page
- `src/pages/privacy/index.astro` and `src/pages/terms/index.astro` for the legal pages
- `src/components/` for shared site navigation and footer
- `src/islands/` for React components hydrated with Astro's client directives; animations use `motion/react`
- `src/styles/global.css` for landing-only Tailwind, Geist fonts, and the system-driven dark variant
- `src/lib/site.ts` for typed release and install constants
- `src/changelog-renderer.ts` for build-time `CHANGELOG.md` parsing and rendering
- `src/download-cta.ts` for copying the Homebrew install command
- `public/` for copied brand assets, the committed OG image, and `.nojekyll`
- `dist/` for generated static output

The site is a static multi-page build. It does not use React Router or any client-side routing fallback.
The homepage links directly to the stable Apple silicon GitHub Release alias without JavaScript or browser architecture detection.
The homepage release stamp is build-time data: the typed `VERSION_LABEL` constant imports the root app version from the repository `package.json`, so the published site shows the same semver that release automation cuts.
The changelog page at `/changelog/` is also build-time data: it reads the root `CHANGELOG.md`, renders `Unreleased` first as an in-development entry, and then renders dated release entries in the same order as the source file.

## Publishing Topology

Builds happen in this repository. Deployment publishes the generated `packages/landing/dist/` output into the root of `NodexApp/NodexApp.github.io`.

Repository roles:

- `junyudev/nodex`: source code, build logic, CI, and documentation
- `NodexApp/NodexApp.github.io`: published static artifact only

This split matters because the root org site URL `https://nodexapp.github.io` must be served by a repository named `NodexApp.github.io`.

## GitHub Workflows

The repository-wide `.github/workflows/ci.yml` validates the landing build on
every PR and protected-main push as part of its always-run static contracts.
There is no separate landing-only validation workflow or second required check.

- `.github/workflows/deploy-landing-site.yml`
  - runs on `main` changes affecting the landing implementation and on manual dispatch
  - calls the shared exact-SHA deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/_deploy-landing-site.yml`
  - builds the site from one protected-main commit
  - always clones the fixed `NodexApp/NodexApp.github.io` target; callers cannot
    override the destination
  - ordinary deploys replace the built site while preserving the target
    `updates/` tree
  - commits only when there is a diff
  - is also called by release promotion after the immutable app Release is
    verified; that mode projects the Release Bundle's exact signed arm64
    appcast snapshot into `/updates/stable/arm64/appcast.xml`, rejects feed
    rollback or same-version byte drift, and verifies the public bytes and
    immutable enclosures after push

## Required Secrets

The deploy workflow binds the `landing-production` environment, restricted to
protected `main`. Its callers explicitly map this repository Action secret to
the reusable deployment workflow:

- `NODEXAPP_GITHUB_IO_TOKEN`
  - fine-grained GitHub token
  - repository access: `NodexApp/NodexApp.github.io`
  - permission: `Contents: Read and write`

## Pages Configuration

In `NodexApp/NodexApp.github.io`, configure GitHub Pages to publish from the default branch root.

The stable application-update endpoints are:

- `https://nodex.jyu.app/updates/stable/arm64/appcast.xml`

The Pages repository stores only the signed feed control plane. Full ZIPs and
deltas remain immutable assets of the corresponding `junyudev/nodex` GitHub
Release. Feed recovery replays a verified release snapshot; it does not
regenerate or re-sign an existing release.

No SPA fallback is needed. `packages/landing/public/CNAME` is part of the
production custom-domain contract and must remain in the generated Pages tree;
`nodexapp.github.io` is only the underlying Pages host.

## Content Notes

The v1 site is intentionally narrow:

- a single-screen homepage
- a generated changelog page at `/changelog/`
- a primary release CTA
- a secondary Homebrew install affordance
- minimal privacy and terms pages

Release CTA contract:

- default CTA target: `https://github.com/junyudev/nodex/releases/latest/download/Nodex-latest-arm64.dmg`
- Nodex requires Apple silicon and macOS 15 or later; the CTA does not select an architecture.

If the site later expands into screenshots, FAQ, or longer-form product copy, keep that work inside `packages/landing` rather than pulling renderer code into the package.
